🚨 Detecting Credit Card Fraud with Machine Learning
💳 Turning raw data into real-world protection.
Have you ever imagined waking up to find your account drained due to fraud — in a country you’ve never even visited?
That’s the growing reality in digital finance, and I wanted to build something that could fight it.
🔍 Project Highlight
 Using a Kaggle dataset with 284,807 credit card transactions (only 492 frauds!), I built a machine learning pipeline to detect fraud with over 99.99% accuracy.
But more importantly:
 ✅ 100% recall — meaning every fraudulent transaction was caught.
 ✅ Very low false positives — minimizing disruptions to genuine users.
 ✅ Interpretable models — Decision Tree & Random Forest for clarity.
📊 Challenges I Solved:
Handling severe class imbalance
Scaling features & applying PCA
Avoiding overfitting with clean preprocessing
Choosing the right evaluation metrics beyond just accuracy
🛠️ Skills & Tools I Used:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
Data balancing with SMOTE
Evaluation with Precision, Recall, F1-Score
🎯 Why This Matters:
 In real-world fintech, catching just one missed fraud can mean a huge financial loss.
 That's why I focused on recall-first modeling — and this project proves that traditional ML, when tuned right, can compete with advanced solutions.
📌 What’s Next?
Integrating with PyCaret and XGBoost
Exploring deep learning for sequence-based fraud
Building a real-time fraud detection system
